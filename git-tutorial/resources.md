There are lots of resources about learning Git on the internet. Here are a few of them:

1) https://learngitbranching.js.org/
    * interactive gamified tutorial
    * topics covered:
        * commits
        * branching
        * rebasing vs. merging commits
        * undoing changes
        * cherry-picking
        * cloning
        * pushing
2) Git [Docs](https://git-scm.com/docs)
    * Like typescriptlang.org, but for Git
    * Has every command, and every flag those commands take
3) Google!
    * Once you know the vocabulary, you'll be able to solve every Git problem from a StackOverflow question or the Git docs.
